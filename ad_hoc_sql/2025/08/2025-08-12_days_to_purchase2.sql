-- Purpose: New-recruit purchases with first-touch attribution, days-to-purchase,
--          and a count of all sessions up to (and including) the purchase.
-- Strategy:
--   1) Build first-touch with "best of both worlds" (prefer ga_session_number; fallback to earliest timestamp)
--   2) Build a per-transaction purchase snapshot (timestamp, revenue, etc.)
--   3) Count all sessions per user with session_start_timestamp_utc <= purchase_ts
--   4) Join everything; exclude users with multiple "new orders" (dup ambiguity)
